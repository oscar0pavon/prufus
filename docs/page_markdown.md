You can create a bootable USB with Windows installer from GNU/Linux. And then you can install Windows on another computer. Useful for computer repair people or if you want to go back to Windows from Linux after a disappointment.  
This is an open source project with GPL 3 license. That means you can modify it like you want, change the name or even sell it as long as you distribute with your changes to the source code.  



# Warning
